                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">We celebrated the World Food Day on 25th November 2020 with the exhibition of food varieties in our campus to commemorate the 77th year of establishment of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) on 16th October 1945. FAO as one of the specialised agencies of the United Nations makes efforts at international level to defeat hunger. The get-together of children and youth emphasised the importance of access and assurance of food security to the poor and the underprivileged. The theme of the World Food Day was ‘Safe food now for a healthy tomorrow’.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">The guest speakers highlighted the problems of global hunger. They emphasised the importance of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) i.e., Zero Hunger. They stressed the need for everyone to play their part in bringing forward those left behind by making our agriculture food systems more inclusive and sustainable. </p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4s">They requested the children and youth to promote worldwide awareness and action for those who suffer from hunger and for the need to ensure healthy diets for all. They told them to organize many awareness initiatives to educate people about malnutrition and obesity, both of which cause major health consequences. </p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s">One of the guest speakers informed that The Hunger Hotspots Outlook (2020-21), a report by the FAO and World Food Programme (WFP) — forebodes escalating hunger. Moreover The Global Report on Food Crises 2021 released in May by the Global Network against Food Crises underscored that about 180 million people across 40 countries will face inescapable food insecurity. The Global Hunger Report, 2021 says the globally, the progress against hunger has largely stagnated in recent years, with a global score of 18.2 in 2021 as compared to 19.1 in 2014, there is only a slight improvement,</p>

                <hr>
                <!-- <h3 class="text-center py-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.1s">Purpose</h3> -->
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">We celebrated Children’s Day on November 20th 2020 to mark the birth anniversary of independent India’s first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. We celebrated the day with the participation of our school children and students in front of our college premises. </p>              
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">The former principal of our college Krishna Kumar and Chancellor Tamilselvan participated and conducted a sports competition for the school students and gave them prizes</p>              
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4s">While delivering the keynote address, the Chancellor said that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru as the freedom fighter and politician was extremely fond of children and was fondly called ‘Uncle Nehru’ by them. Even after years of his death, he is remembered by that name and in honour of his legacy and fondness for children, his birth anniversary is celebrated as Children’s Day. </p>              
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s">He further said that initially Children’s Day in India was celebrated on November 20 in accordance with the Universal Children’s Day declared by the United Nations. However, after Jawaharlal Nehru’s demise in 1964, a resolution was passed in the Indian Parliament that declared November 14 as Children’s Day to honour the legacy of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. The day, as opposed to popular belief, is not a gazetted holiday but children are encouraged to go to school and be a part of the celebrations of this day. In our educational institutions, this day is marked with special assemblies and functions. We organize events like quizzes, cultural activities, plays, fancy dress competitions, etc., to increase participation and make children aware of the rich historical past of the country and the eminent personalities that were a part of it. </p>              
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">In his special address, Mr Krishna Kumar said that in addition to commemorating the great leader, the day is also a reminder that every child, irrespective of their caste, creed, financial or political status, deserves basic amenities that include education, nurturing, healthcare and sanitation. He further said that since children are the future of the nation, they hold within them immense potential and to channel it constructively, is a responsibility that the entire nation should shoulder. Apart from providing basic rights to children, it is also important to save them from prominent social evils like child trafficking, assault and child labour, which is a sheer atrocity and wastage of priceless human resources.</p>

                <!-- <h3 class="text-center py-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.1s">Purpose</h3> -->
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">Human Rights Day is a significant observance that commemorates the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. It is a day to celebrate and recognize the fundamental rights and freedoms that are inherent to every individual, regardless of race, gender, religion, or any other status.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Our college places great emphasis on human rights and its celebration, which is marked every year on December 10th. The college community organizes various activities and events to promote awareness and engagement with human rights issues. These activities aim to educate and empower students, staff, and faculty to become advocates for social justice and human rights.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4s">Human Rights Day was celebrated on December 26th 2020 at S Joseph's College of Education, Kalakad. Advocate Maria Stephen and Advocate Murugan participated in the program as special guests. They gave special speeches to the students about the Judiciary with the idea that every human being has the right to live freely and get basic needs like freedom of expression, right to write, education, medicine, health and drinking water.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s">One of the highlights of the college's celebration of Human Rights Day is the keynote speaker event. This event features a renowned human rights advocate, who speaks on a topic related to human rights, social justice, or diversity and inclusion. The keynote speaker's presentations are usually followed by a question-and-answer session, where attendees can engage with the speaker and further their understanding of the topic.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">Another popular activity during the celebration is the human rights film screening. The college screened a documentary that raised awareness of a human rights issue. After the screening, a panel discussion was held to allow attendees to discuss and share their thoughts and perspectives on the issue.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">In addition to these events, the college also hosted workshops and training sessions that provide attendees with tools and resources to become active in promoting human rights. These workshops covered a variety of topics, including advocacy and lobbying, diversity and inclusion, and social justice.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.8s">The college also encouraged students to get involved in human rights activities beyond the campus. Students were encouraged to participate in human rights organizations, attend protests and rallies, and volunteer for human rights causes. The college provided resources and connections to organizations that focus on human rights advocacy, enabling students to engage in meaningful work in their communities. </p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.9s">The celebration of Human Rights Day was not only important for promoting awareness and engagement with human rights issues, but it also aligned with the college's mission of developing responsible citizens and leaders. By promoting human rights education and advocacy, the college aims to instil in its students a sense of social responsibility and a commitment to justice.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1.0s">In conclusion, the college's celebration of Human Rights Day was an essential observance that promotes awareness, education, and advocacy for human rights. Through its various activities and events, the college provided students, staff, and faculty with the tools and resources they need to become effective advocates for social justice and human rights.

                <hr>
                <!-- <h3 class="text-center py-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.1s">Purpose</h3> -->
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">Currently, a significant environmental problem is plastic trash. Every year, millions of tons of plastic end up in landfills and the ocean, causing harm to wildlife, ecosystems, and human health. As such, there is a growing need for plastic awareness among individuals, communities, and businesses.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Hence, both the Kalakad Panchayat Union and St. Joseph College of Education jointly organized an awareness program on September 25, 2020 under the theme of Swachh Bharath Movement to create a plastic-free India.  The Village Administrative Officer participated and delivered a special speech.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4s">In his special speech, the VAO said that one of the biggest challenges with plastic waste is the fact that it takes hundreds of years to decompose. As a result, plastic waste can remain in the environment for a very long time, causing harm to wildlife and ecosystems. To address this issue, there is a need for greater awareness of the importance of reducing, reusing, and recycling plastic.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s">He further said that reducing plastic usage is the first step in plastic awareness. This involves using fewer plastic products in our daily lives, such as single-use plastic bags, bottles, and straws. Instead, individuals can opt for reusable alternatives such as cloth bags, refillable water bottles, and metal straws. Businesses can also play a role in reducing plastic waste by using more sustainable packaging and reducing the amount of plastic in their products.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">He continued to say that reusing plastic is another important aspect of plastic awareness. This involves finding new uses for plastic products rather than throwing them away. For example, plastic containers can be reused for storage, and plastic bags can be used as trash can liners. By finding ways to reuse plastic products, individuals and businesses can reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills and the ocean.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">He further added that recycling plastic is also essential for plastic awareness. This involves properly disposing of plastic products so that they can be recycled and turned into new products. Recycling not only reduces the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the environment but also conserves natural resources by reducing the need for new materials.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.8s">In addition to reducing, reusing, and recycling plastic, he said, there are other ways to raise awareness about the importance of plastic waste reduction. Education and outreach programs can help to inform individuals and communities about the impact of plastic waste on the environment and human health. These programs can include public events, social media campaigns, and educational materials such as brochures and posters.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.9s">Government regulations can also play a role in plastic awareness. Many countries and cities have implemented policies to reduce plastic waste, such as banning single-use plastic bags and straws. These policies can help to create a culture of plastic awareness and encourage individuals and businesses to reduce their plastic usage.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1.0s">In conclusion, plastic awareness is crucial for addressing the issue of plastic waste. By reducing, reusing, and recycling plastic products, individuals and businesses can help to reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the environment. Education and outreach programs, as well as government policies, can also play a role in raising awareness about the importance of plastic waste reduction. By working together, we can create a more sustainable future and protect our environment for generations to come.</p>

                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">Tailoring training is an essential component of any skill-building program. It involves customizing training to meet the specific needs of an individual or a group of individuals, based on their skills, knowledge, and experience. Tailored training can help to improve learning outcomes, increase productivity, and enhance job performance.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Therefore, with a view to equip women with tailoring skills, WCDS organized tailoring training to 20 unemployed women in our centre to suit the needs of different learners. This means that training was designed to cater to learners with different learning styles, backgrounds, and skill levels. By tailoring training to suit the needs of individual learners, trainers ensured that they are better able to engage with the material and apply it in their work.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4s">Tailored training also helped to improve learning outcomes. Since the training was designed to meet the specific needs of learners, it was more effective in helping them to acquire new skills and knowledge. This helped to improve job performance and increase productivity.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s">Furthermore, tailored training helped to enhance job performance. By providing learners with the specific skills and knowledge they were expected to perform their job, training helped to improve their confidence and competence. This led to better job performance, higher job satisfaction, and increased employee retention.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">In addition, we assisted he trained women with bank loans for launching their own tailoring and garments making units. </p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">In conclusion, tailored training is an important component of any skill-building program. It helped to improve learning outcomes, increase productivity, enhance job performance, and reduce training costs. By customizing training to meet the specific needs of individual learners, trainers ensured that they are better able to engage with the material and apply it in their work.</p>

                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">Computer training could have a significant impact on the lives of poor girls, providing them with the knowledge and skills they need to improve their quality of life and increase their economic opportunities.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">The purpose of computer training for poor girls was multi-faceted. Firstly, it provided them with digital literacy, which is essential in today's world where technology is ubiquitous. With computer training, girls could learn how to use basic software applications, navigate the internet, and access information and resources online.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4s">With this purpose in mind, WCDS imparted computer training, from which 20 poor girls from Nanguneri and Kalakad blocks benefited. They were trained in computer skills, spoken English, office management, and personality development. After the successful completion of the training, the trainees were given certificates of completion. This would help them get employed within and outside the state.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.5s">Moreover, computer training can empower poor girls to pursue better job opportunities. With the skills gained through computer training, they can find employment in the growing technology industry, which could provide them with a stable income and greater financial independence. In addition, computer skills could help girls start their own businesses, which can help them generate income and support their families.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.6s">Furthermore, computer training could help poor girls to access education and healthcare resources. With the ability to access online resources, they could learn more about health and nutrition, access educational materials and connect with healthcare professionals remotely.</p>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.7s">Overall, computer training could help poor girls break the cycle of poverty, by providing them with valuable skills, knowledge, and resources that can improve their quality of life and increase their economic opportunities.</p>
